# SymmetryGroupPuzzle

SymmetryGroupPuzzle is an attempt to implement a 2-dimensional twisty-puzzle game using Python.
It will initially be implemented as a PyQt5/OpenGL application, but there's a chance I might also
try to get it working as a web-app way down the road.  It depends on whether I can find a good
solution for fast off-screen rendering, and whether a round-trip between the browser and server
can be made fast enough.  In any case, to really make this idea a web-app, I think it would all
need to be written client-side using JS, but I really hate the JS language.
