    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome!  This page features a kind of twisty puzzle based upon the symmetries of overlapping shapes.
        Every shape of the plane has an associated group of symmetries (even if it's just the trivial group!)
        A symmetry of a shape is simply any way you can remove it from the plane (leaving a hole in its place),
        re-orient the shape in your hand, and then fit the shape back into the hole.  If we overlap a bunch of shapes
        in the plane, then we can get a larger group of transformations constructed from the individual symmetry groups
        of each shape.  Your job, given any element of this group, is to find a factorization of that element
        in terms of a given set of generators.
    </p>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>
        The puzzle above is completely mouse driven.  Hovering over the desired shape, use the mouse wheel to
        rotate the shape clock-wise or counter-click-wise; or click on the shape to reflect it across an axis
        near the location of the mouse cursor.  That's it!
    </p>
    <p>
        The buttons up-top let you cycle through the various puzzles and images available.  A button below
        lets you scramble the current puzzle.  Notice that animation and hover-highlights can be toggled.
    </p>
    <h2>Group Theory</h2>
    <p>
        Group theory is a beautiful subject, and so I can't help but give here a few of my thoughts on the
        subject as it relates to twisty puzzles.  Do that here...talk about homorphisms and factor groups, conjugates
        and commutators, and maybe even stabilizer chains.
